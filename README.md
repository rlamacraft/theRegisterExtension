# What does it do?
Cleans up theregister.co.uk's comments section, Reddit style.

Ever tried to read the comment's section/forum at theregister.co.uk??? It's a spaghetti mess of interwoven message threads!

Wouldn't it be nice if they were arranged in a simple Reddit-style hierarchy of replies, colour coded for the depth of the message, and with the ability to close sub-threads. Problem solved.

# How does it work?
Pulls in all of the comments on a forum.theregister.co.uk page and from all of the overflow pages. Builds a tree-like model. Then renders the tree into much nicer visual format.

# Where can I get it?
